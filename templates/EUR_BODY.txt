Dear Customer,

We would like to inform you that we have claims against your company,
which have not yet been paid and are overdue as of today.

These documents are: {}

For the total amount: {} Euro

We believe that this has happened inadvertently, but please check and pay
them to our bank account as soon as possible, or when they will be paid.
If the claims have already been paid, please provide us with the information,
when and how the payments were made so that we can check - ideally by
sending us a confirmation of the transaction.

Failure to pay invoices when they are due puts you at risk of suspension
delivery of further goods and services and the payment of interest on
overdue invoices.

If you are unsure, please contact our sales department at
+420 777 889 869 or write to fakturace@frpneu.cz


Thank you for your consideration,

kind regards
